This project may never open up again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I got reply for following issue. 
`Syntax rule 'begin-end' stretch over too much, and extend it's parent range out · Issue #58551 · Microsoft/vscode <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58551>`_

So I shifted to modify and use locally the syntax rule in existing extension. 
Currenly modification is just to exclude multiline link, and it may be enough to me. 
It is easy tweek and I convince that original author intend to include multiline link.
That is, it is the issue of product design, 
so I do not send pull request and do not issue anything about it.
I Just stop this project.
